Ask for page a name <page_name>
Ask for a page reference in our codebase ( give us each folder name and path) <reference>
Ask if we need sub pages <sub_pages>

When you have all the information create a page based on our codebase example : 


let's build a similar page named <page_name> as <reference>  by opening and analysing the structure, here is what i need
- _translation folder with the json file named "<page_name>.en.json and the users.translate.ts file that you can import into to /shared/translation/en.ts, and spread it like ...en<PageName>Translation,
- Layout with the new routes that you can add to router.ts, and same rendering
- "login" sub page
- pages can be empty for now
- don't copy features only the layout and the page
