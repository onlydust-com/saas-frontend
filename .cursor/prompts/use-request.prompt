Ask for the request description <request_description>


from core/application/react-query-adapter you use an adapter that be adapter to <request_description>

for exemple if i say i want to get the supported currencies, you will use : 

const { data, isLoading, isError } = CurrencyReactQueryAdapter.client.useGetSupportedCurrencies({});
