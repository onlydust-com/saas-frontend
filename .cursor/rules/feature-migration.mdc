## Migration Guidelines

### Migration Process

1. Identify components that need migration

   - Scan for components using `@/design-system/*` imports
   - Prioritize frequently used components
   - Create a list of dependencies for each component

2. Create a migration plan

   - Document the equivalent shadcn/ui component
   - List all props that need to be mapped
   - Identify breaking changes
   - Plan for backwards compatibility if needed

3. Implement changes incrementally

   - Migrate one component at a time
   - Test thoroughly in isolation
   - Update all instances of the component

4. Update documentation

   - Mark old components as deprecated
   - Document new implementation
   - Update component usage examples

5. Remove deprecated code
   - Only after all instances are migrated
   - Verify no remaining imports exist
   - Remove from design system directory

### Do's and Don'ts

#### Do's ✅

- DO use `@/shared/ui/*` for new shadcn component imports
- DO maintain a migration tracking document
- DO update component props to match shadcn/ui API
- DO test components in all scenarios they're used
- DO add TypeScript types for all new components
- DO keep commits focused on single component migrations
- DO add migration status comments to files being worked on

#### Don'ts ❌

- DON'T mix design-system and shadcn/ui components in the same component
- DON'T create new components in the design-system directory
- DON'T modify existing design-system components (except for critical fixes)
- DON'T remove design-system components until all usages are migrated
- DON'T copy design-system styles to new components
- DON'T create wrapper components to maintain old APIs

### Documentation Requirements

- Document components still using the design system:

  ```typescript
  /**
   * @component ComponentName
   * @deprecated Use shadcn/ui ComponentName instead
   * @migration-status [Not Started|In Progress|Completed]
   * @migration-plan docs/migration/component-name.md
   * @target-component @/shared/ui/component-name
   */
  ```

- Migration tracking document should include:
  - Component name
  - Current status
  - Breaking changes
  - Migration blockers
  - Dependencies
  - Test coverage status

### Migration Example

```typescript
// OLD Implementation ❌
import { Button } from "@/design-system/atoms/button";
import { Icon } from "@/design-system/atoms/icon";

// NEW Implementation ✅
import { Button } from "@/shared/ui/button";
import { Icon } from "@/shared/ui/icon";

// Example of deprecated component with proper documentation
/**
 * @component LegacyButton
 * @deprecated Use shadcn Button component from @/shared/ui/button
 * @migration-status In Progress
 * @migration-plan docs/migration/legacy-button.md
 * @target-component @/shared/ui/button
 *
 * Breaking Changes:
 * - 'type' prop renamed to 'variant'
 * - 'isLoading' prop replaced with 'loading'
 * - Custom themes no longer supported
 */
```
